Welcome to the Save Gudetama typing game! The typing game for "adults."

For 2-player, hit "Enter." For single-player, click "Start."

Suggestions for where to go from here - take or leave!
- allow users to join a "board" like Hack Reactor, where high scores are displayed. Allow users to challenge other users to create dynamic "rooms." (Right now, the "room" is hardcoded to "scottVsLina" in index.jsx). You'll have to change the data schema to do this.
- game logic - sometimes there are bugs with the logic in server/index.js to determine who is in the "room." These will probably get ironed out if you're tackling the above issue.
- display the round to user
- add spedometer to show typing speed
- CSS - center the cracked egg, show a different GIF depending on if you win or lose, improve the look of the loser's stack of bricks
